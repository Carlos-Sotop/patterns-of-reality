# Event-Driven Investment Thesis Logs | February 12, 2026

**Last Updated:** February 12, 2026, 03:33 UTC  
**Portfolio Allocation:** Concentrated Short Bias with Macro Hedges

---

## Executive Summary

**Core Thesis:** Triple macro convergence creating asymmetric short opportunity in leverage crypto/software names, particularly MicroStrategy (MSTR). Japanese yen carry trade unwind + software valuation compression + Bitcoin underperformance vs. gold.

**Primary Position:** SHORT MicroStrategy (MSTR) at $126  

**Catalysts:**

1) BOJ hike > MSTR crashes
2) AI capex announcements > Copper rallies
3) Power/energy costs rise > Bitcoin mining margins compress, MSTR falls
4) Software earnings > Sector sells off
5) Tariffs add macro uncertainty supporting the risk-off view

## Setup

### 1. Japanese Carry Trade Unwind (23% probability by March 20)

**Current State:**
- **BOJ Rate:** 0.75% (highest since 1995)
- **US Fed Rate:** 3.75% (300bps spread)
- **USD/JPY:** 153.06
- **BOJ Stance:** "Further rate hikes necessary" - Board Member Masu (Feb 6)

**What Changed:**
- BOJ hiked 3x in 2025 (from -0.10% → 0.75%)
- BOJ projecting 1.0% by 2027
- Yen weakness forcing BOJ's hand (import inflation at 1.9%)

**Market Mispricing:**
- Polymarket "Nothing Ever Happens: Interest Rates" = 77% (Fed/BOJ/ECB/BoC all hold)
- This is TOO complacent given BOJ hawkish rhetoric
- **23% probability of rate change = ASYMMETRIC opportunity**

**Historical Precedent:**
- Aug 2024: BOJ surprise hike → markets crashed -10% in days
- Carry-funded assets (crypto, tech) hit hardest

---

### 2. Gold/Copper Outperformance vs. Bitcoin

**Polymarket Prediction Market Data:**
- **Gold best 2026 performer:** 57% probability ($399K volume)
- **Bitcoin best 2026 performer:** 26% probability
- **Spread:** 31 percentage points

**Current Levels:**
- Gold: $5,071/oz (near ATH, down 0.26% today)
- Copper: $5.97/lbs (ATH)
- Bitcoin: $67,105 (down 0.43%, range-bound)

**Macro Drivers:**
- **Real rates positive** (10Y TIPS at 1.84%) - pressure non-yielding/risk assets
- Geopolitical premium (US-Iran tensions: 53% probability of strikes by June 30)
- Central bank demand for gold continues

---

### 3. Software Valuation Compression

**Evidence:**
- **Microsoft (MSFT):** -2.15% to $404 despite AI investments
- Software multiples: 15-40x sales (historical avg: 5-10x)
- AI is deflationary for SaaS (copilots replacing subscriptions)

**Sector Weakness:**
- Enterprise spending cuts accelerating
- Growth deceleration across SaaS
- Multiple compression underway

---

## The Trade: SHORT MicroStrategy (MSTR)

### Why MSTR?

1. **Bitcoin Leverage:** MSTR has 3-4x operational leverage to BTC price
   - BTC -10% → MSTR -30% (typical)
   - Holds ~$15B in Bitcoin, $15B net debt

2. **Carry Trade Exposure:** Bitcoin is heavily carry-funded
   - Borrow yen at 0.75%, buy BTC at higher expected returns
   - Carry unwind = forced BTC liquidation
   - MSTR gets hit harder than spot BTC

3. **Software Valuation:** Even base business under pressure
   - Legacy BI software business declining
   - Software multiples compressing sector-wide
   - No moat vs. modern alternatives

**Current Price Action:**
- Already showing technical weakness
- Breaking support levels

---

## Scenario Analysis

### Scenario 1: BOJ Hikes March 19 (23% probability)
**Actions:**
- Short MSTR, COIN, crypto 
- Long JPY 
- Long VIX 
- Short software basket 

---

### Scenario 2: Iran Escalation (17% by Feb 28, 53% by June)
**Cross-correlation with carry unwind:**
- Risk-off > Yen strengthens
- Energy/Defense rally
- BTC/crypto sells off (risk asset)
- MSTR amplifies downside

---

### Scenario 3: Software Cascade (40% probability)
**Independent of carry trade:**
- MSFT weakness spreads sector-wide
- MSTR re-rated lower
- Software basket shorts
- Even without BTC crash, multiple compresses

---

### Scenario 4: "Nothing Happens" - Status Quo (40% probability)
**Market consensus: All central banks hold, no geopolitical events**

**Our view: STILL BEARISH for MSTR**
- Positive real rates persist
- Gold continues outperforming BTC (57% vs 26%)
- Software multiples compress gradually
- No catalyst for Bitcoin breakout

3. **Bitcoin breaks $75K** decisively
4. **USD/JPY below 150** - unwind worries (140 lowest since May 2023)
5. **MSTR above $145** - thesis invalidated

### Position Sizing

- JPY long: 30%
