Before the "Enlightment" (c. 1600s), societies ran on 3 pillars:

1) Tradition. (We do this because our ancestors did).
2) Authority. (Kings, priest, aristocrats).
3) Divinity. (Truth comes from God, scripture and interpretation of it).

This was a system that worked until science and information started spreading with the printing press, and with that, new questions started to emerge. If power was no longer inhereted by divinity and truth was no longer in myths but discovered, then all the legacy institutions built on ancient premise were doomed to collapse.

The questions around power, society and the self were the more relevant. That is: 
Power: Who should rule? 
Individuals: What are my rights and my purpose? 
Society: What is the source of authority and how should society be organized?
