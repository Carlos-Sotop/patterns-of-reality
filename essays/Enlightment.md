Enlightenment ideals are the set of ideas (1600s–1700s) that said reason, individual rights, and limits on authority should replace tradition, monarchy, and divine-right power.

Before the "Enlightment" (c. 1600s), societies ran on 3 pillars:

1) Tradition. (We do this because our ancestors did).
2) Authority. (Kings, priest, aristocrats).
3) Divinity. (Truth comes from God, scripture and interpretation of it).

This was a system that worked until science and information started spreading with the printing press, and with that, new questions started to emerge. If power was no longer inhereted by divinity and truth was no longer in myths but discovered, then all the legacy institutions built on ancient premise were doomed to collapse.

The questions around power, society and the self were the more relevant. That is: 
Power: Who should rule? 
Individuals: What are my rights and my purpose? 
Society: What is the source of authority and how should society be organized? 

These ideas destroyed the ideological foundation of Louis XVI’s monarchy. Once people believe power should come from reason and rights, a monarchy becomes illegitimate.

The main elements of Enlightment are:

1) Reason over tradition
Use logic, not “because the king says so.”

2) Individual rights
People are born with rights. The state doesn't “grant” them.

3) Consent of the governed
Political power must come from the people, not God or bloodlines.

4) Rule of law
The law binds everyone, including rulers.

5) Separation of powers
Don’t let one guy control everything. Split power to prevent abuse.

6) Freedom of speech and thought
You can criticize power. You can think independently.

7) Skepticism toward absolute monarchy and the Church
No more “God chose the king” as a political argument.
