Polybius wrote about the different cycles inherent in politics. He called the evolution of these cycles anacyclosis.

He proposed six stages, cycling between good and bad forms of government:
1) Monarchy (rule by one, just).
2) Tyranny (monarchy turns corrypt).
3) Aristrocacy (rule by the best, just).
4) Oligarchy (aristrocracy turns corrupt).
5) Democracy (rule by the many, just).
6) Ochlocracy (mob rule, chaos, democracy turns corrupt).

He described them as systems that initially arose in virtue to solve a current problem in society, but the same origin of such systems contained the seed of their own destruction.

As it evolves, it degenerates, almost like a rule of nature, decaying into a distorted version of itself before collapsing and restarting in another form.

There are modern adaptations, but the core idea is that no political system is stable forever.

One key marker in the emergence of a new governing order always involves:
- a mission (shared goal), or
- a threat (shared enemy), or
- both (the strongest formula)

With time, and as that mission is accomplised or that threat is neutralized, the unifying narrative begins to fade, and without a cohesive narrative, citizens lose purpose, and different power factions begin to form among the elite. This is the so called original seed of self-destruction unfolding, the group unites on a common goal, but once that common goal has already been accomplised the collapse of the group begins.

Bad leaders fail because they either a) fail to renew the long-term mission, or b) lacking substance, build coercive systems to hold the collapsing status quo together. Examples of this are:

**Failure to Renew Mission:**
- **Commodus** (180-192 AD) inherited a stable empire from Marcus Aurelius, but his rule marked a break from Stoic duty toward self-indulgence, court corruption, and political instability. His vanity, mismanagement, and reliance on corrupt favorites weakened imperial authority and set off a chain of turmoil that helped push Rome toward the Crisis of the Third Century.

- **Louis XVI** of France, who inherited a system designed for absolutist expansion but had no vision for a nation facing bankruptcy and Enlightenment ideals. His indecisiveness and inability to articulate a renewed purpose left a vacuum filled by revolution.

- **Leonid Brezhnev** and the gerontocracy of late Soviet leadership (Andropov, Chernenko), who inherited a completed revolution but offered only "stability" and stagnation. With no mission beyond maintaining power, the USSR became a cynical shell that Gorbachev's reforms couldn't save.


**Coercive Systems to Maintain Control:**
- **Dowager Empress Cixi** crushed the Hundred Days’ Reform in 1898, executed key reformers, and then tried to rally the empire by casting foreign powers as an existential enemy. Backing the Boxer uprising was her bid to unify the empire through a shared threat, but it was a delusional mission: the state was too weak, the enemy too strong, and modernization was the only viable path she had already closed. Her attempt at mission-renewal became a coercive, reactive mobilization that hastened the Qing dynasty’s collapse.

- **Sultan Abdul Hamid II** suspended the constitution, dissolved parliament, and built a vast surveillance and censorship apparatus to maintain control as the Ottoman Empire’s legitimacy eroded. Instead of confronting the empire’s structural decay, he relied on repression, including tolerating and enabling large-scale violence against Armenians in the 1890s. His regime survived through coercion, accelerating the empire’s political breakdown.

- **Nicolae Ceaușescu** built one of the most extreme cults of personality in the Eastern Bloc, presenting himself and his wife as infallible “geniuses” while the Securitate terrorized the population. By the late 1980s, communist ideology in Romania had no credibility left; the regime endured solely through fear. When that fear finally broke during the 1989 uprising, as the public booed him on live television and the army refused to fire on civilians, the entire system collapsed in days.

The pattern is consistent: when the original justification for power erodes, leaders either reinvent the mission or rely on coercion. Reinvention can produce renewal if it’s grounded in real capacity and legitimacy. Coercion can delay collapse, sometimes for a surprisingly long time, but it cannot reverse the underlying decay. It only preserves a system that has already stopped evolving.

This is why transitions between stages rarely happen on their own. They usually require either a genuine crisis that creates a new unifying threat, or a transformational leader who can articulate a new mission. Without either force, systems don’t evolve and drift on inertia, regulation, or coercion until an external shock or internal rupture finally forces the next turn of the cycle.
