Polybius wrote about the different cycles inherent in politics. He called the evolution of these cycles anacyclosis.

He proposed six stages, cycling between good and bad forms of government:
1) Monarchy (rule by one, just)
2) Tyranny (monarchy turns corrypt)
3) Aristrocacy (rule by the best, just)
4) Oligarchy (aristrocracy turns corrupt)
5) Democracy (rule by the many, just)
6) Ochlocracy (mob rule, chaos, democracy turns corrupt)

He described them as systems that initially arose in virtue to solve a current problem in society, but the same origin of such systems contained the seed of their own destruction.

As it evolves, it degenerates, almost like a rule of nature, decaying into a distorted version of itself before collapsing and restarting in another form.

There are modern adaptations, but the core idea is that no political system is stable forever.

One key marker in the emergence of a new governing order always involves:
- a mission (shared goal), or
- a threat (shared enemy), or
- both (the strongest formula)

With time, and as that mission is accomplised or that threat is neutralized, the unifying narrative begins to fade, and without a cohesive narrative, citizens lose purpose, and different power factions begin to form among the elite. This is the so called original seed of self-destruction unfolding, the group unites on a common goal, but once that common goal has already been accomplised the collapse of the group begins.

Bad leaders fail because they either a) fail to renew the long-term mission, or b) lacking substance, build coercive systems to hold the collapsing status quo together. Examples of this are:

**Failure to Renew Mission:**
- **Commodus** (180-192 AD) inherited a stable empire from Marcus Aurelius, but his rule marked a sharp break from Stoic duty toward self-indulgence, court corruption, and political instability. His vanity, mismanagement, and reliance on corrupt favorites weakened imperial authority and set off a chain of turmoil that helped push Rome toward the Crisis of the Third Century.

- **Louis XVI** of France, who inherited a system designed for absolutist expansion but had no vision for a nation facing bankruptcy and Enlightenment ideals. His indecisiveness and inability to articulate a renewed purpose left a vacuum filled by revolution.
- **Leonid Brezhnev** and the gerontocracy of late Soviet leadership (Andropov, Chernenko), who inherited a completed revolution but offered only "stability" and stagnation. With no mission beyond maintaining power, the USSR became a cynical shell that Gorbachev's reforms couldn't save.


**Coercive Systems to Maintain Control:**
- **Dowager Empress Cixi** and the late Qing court, who responded to reform pressure with the execution of the Hundred Days' Reform leaders and support for the Boxer Rebellion, choosing xenophobia and repression over adaptation.
- **Sultan Abdul Hamid II** of the Ottoman Empire, who suspended the constitution, employed vast spy networks, and unleashed ethnic violence against Armenians rather than address the empire's fundamental legitimacy crisis.
- **Nicolae Ceaușescu** in Romania, who built a cult of personality and deployed the Securitate to terrorize the population as communist ideology lost all credibility. His regime survived on fear alone until it collapsed in days.

The pattern is consistent: when the original justification for power erodes, leaders either reinvent the mission or resort to coercion. The former requires vision and legitimacy; the latter accelerates decay. 

This is why successful transitions between stages often require either genuine crisis (providing new threats) or transformational leadership (articulating new missions). Without either, systems limp forward until external shock or internal rupture forces the next turn of the cycle.
