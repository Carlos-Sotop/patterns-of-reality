Polybius wrote about the different cycles inherent in politics. He called the evolution of these cycles anacyclosis.

He proposed six stages, cycling between good and bad forms of government:
1) Monarchy (rule by one, just)
2) Tyranny (monarchy turns corrypt)
3) Aristrocacy (rule by the best, just)
4) Oligarchy (aristrocracy turns corrupt)
5) Democracy (rule by the many, just)
6) Ochlocracy (mob rule, chaos, democracy turns corrupt)

He described them as systems that initially arose in virtue to solve a current problem in society, but the same origin of such systems contained the seed of their own destruction.

As it evolves, it degenerates, almost like a rule of nature, decaying into a distorted version of itself before collapsing and restarting in another form.

There are modern adaptations, but the core idea is that no political system is stable forever.

One key marker in the emergence of a new governing order always involves:
- a mission (shared goal), or
- a threat (shared enemy), or
- both (the strongest formula)

With time, and as that mission is accomplised or that threat is neutralized, the unifying narrative begins to fade, and without a cohesive narrative, citizens lose purpose, and different power factions begin to form among the elite. This is the so called original seed of self-destruction unfolding, the group unites on a common goal, but once that common goal has already been accomplised the collapse of the group begins.

Bad leaders fail because they either a) fail to renew the long-term mission, or b) lacking substance, build coercive systems to hold the collapsing status quo together. Examples of this are:
