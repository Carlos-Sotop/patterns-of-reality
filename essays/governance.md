Polybius wrote about the different cycles inherent in politics. He called the evolution of these cycles anacyclosis.

He proposed six stages, cycling between good and bad forms of government:
1) Monarchy (rule by one, just)
2) Tyranny (monarchy turns corrypt)
3) Aristrocacy (rule by the best, just)
4) Oligarchy (aristrocracy turns corrupt)
5) Democracy (rule by the many, just)
6) Ochlocracy (mob rule, chaos, democracy turns corrupt)

He described them as systems that initially arose in virtue to solve a current problem in society, but the same origin of such systems contained the seed of their own destruction.

As it evolves, it degenerates, almost like a rule of nature, decaying into a distorted version of itself before collapsing and restarting in another form.

There are modern adaptations, but the core idea is that no political system is stable forever.

One key marker in the emergence of a new governing order always involves:
- a mission (shared goal), or
- a threat (shared enemy), or
- both (the strongest formula)

With time, and as that mission is accomplised or that threat is neutralized, the unifying narrative begins to fade, and without a cohesive narrative, citizens lose purpose, and different power factions begin to form among the elite. This is the so called original seed of self-destruction unfolding, the group unites on a common goal, but once that common goal has already been accomplised the collapse of the group begins.

Bad leaders fail because they either a) fail to renew the long-term mission, or b) lacking substance, build coercive systems to hold the collapsing status quo together. Examples of this are:

**Failure to Renew Mission:**
- Late Roman emperors who, after centuries of expansion and consolidation, offered no compelling vision beyond maintenance, leading to internal fragmentation and loss of civic virtue
- The Soviet Union's post-revolutionary generations, who inherited a completed revolution but received only stagnant bureaucracy rather than renewed purpose, resulting in cynicism and eventual collapse
- European monarchies in the 19th century that clung to divine right while failing to articulate a modern role, making them vulnerable to nationalist and democratic movements

**Coercive Systems to Maintain Control:**
- The Qing Dynasty's increasingly repressive measures in its final decades, using force to suppress reform movements rather than adapting to new realities
- The late Ottoman Empire's turn to authoritarianism and ethnic scapegoating as its multi-ethnic imperial mission became untenable
- Eastern European communist regimes in the 1980s, which relied on secret police and censorship as ideological conviction evaporated

The pattern is consistent: when the original justification for power erodes, leaders either reinvent the mission or resort to coercion. The former requires vision and legitimacy; the latter accelerates decay. 

This is why successful transitions between stages often require either genuine crisis (providing new threats) or transformational leadership (articulating new missions). Without either, systems limp forward until external shock or internal rupture forces the next turn of the cycle.
