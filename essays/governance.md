Polybius wrote about the different cycles inherent in politics, he called the
evolution of these cycles, anacyclosis. 

He described them as systems that initially arised in virtue to solve a
current problem in society, but the same origin of such systems 
contained the seed of it's own destruction.

He proposed six stages, cycling between good and bad forms of government:
1) Monarchy (rule by one, just)
2) Tyranny (monarchy turns corrypt)
3) Aristrocacy (rule by the best, just)
4) Oligarchy (aristrocracy turns corrupt)
5) Democracy (rule by the many, just)
6) Ochlocracy (mob rule, chaos, democracy turns corrupt)

There are modern adaptations, but the core idea is that no political system
is stable forever. 

As it evolves, it degenerates, almost like a rule of nature, it decayse into a distorted version of itself before collapsing and restarting in another form.
