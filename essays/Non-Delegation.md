Non-delegation is the ability to control critical functions instead of delegating to an external authority.

Why would this be important? if someone else can act for you without asking, you no longer have control.

Many systems today work by delegation. We let banks hold our money (they take "custody" of it). We let platforms store our data (either encrypted or non-encrypted). We let institutions manage our identity, payments, communication, and access. This is convenient at first.

**Delegation Has A Cost**

But there there are risks and costs to delegation, and history has many examples.

**Argentina – The Corralito (2001)**

For years, Argentinians trusted banks with their money. Salaries were paid into accounts and savings were stored normally, until one day the government froze withdrawals. 

The problem was delegation. Once money was held by banks, access depended on permission, and when that permission was removed, ownership really became meaningless.

**Cyprus – Bank Bail-In (2013)**

In Cyprus, people woke up to find part of their savings gone.

Large deposits were seized to save failing banks, and the money was converted into bank shares without consent. Some lost over 40% of their balance.

Depositors learned a simple lesson: if your money is held by someone else, it can be used to fix their problems.

**Greece – Capital Controls (2015)**

Greek banks closed overnight. ATMs had limited withdrawals and International transfers were blocked. Businesses could not pay suppliers, and people could not move their own money.

Again, it stopped working because access was delegated.

**Canada – Truckers’ Protests (2022)**

During the protests, bank accounts were frozen. People who donated money lost access to their funds, and some were not even protesting. Their accounts were flagged through financial monitoring.

In a very dystopian way, financial access was used as a pressure tool. 

**China – Social Credit and Payment Control**

In China, most payments happen through a few platforms, and when access is removed, you literally cannot pay, travel, rent or work normally. 


So the common pattern in all these cases is that the system did not "fail" technically, but actually the opposite, it worked exactly as designed.

When control over critical functions is delegated, those functions can be restricted, frozen, or repurposed without asking.
